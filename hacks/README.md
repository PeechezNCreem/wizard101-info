Do not use this for any purpose other than to make the game more enjoyable for
you and remember that this could get you banned.

Current Features:
- Hotkeys
- System tray menu
- Teleport to quest (with controllable offset)
- Multibox support (should have no limit on active clients)
- Dynamic clients (you can open and close games anytime)
- Single instance
- Pirate101 and Wizard101 support
- Gameforge support for Wizard101

Hotkeys:
- Alt+Q: Teleport to quest.
- Alt+E: Teleport to quest, offset in *current direction.*
- Alt+R: Reset offset.
- Alt+F: Increase offset.
- Alt+C: Decrease offset.

Teleports work slightly differently in Pirate101. Changing your direction will not update your position and teleport with offset is currently not needed.

I uploaded it in an encrypted zip archive to prevent any possible issues downloading. If you share this with anyone, please send them this archive.
