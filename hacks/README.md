# PeechezTrayner

Do not use this for any purpose other than to make the game more enjoyable for
you and remember that this could get you banned.

- Very small, single file application

Hotkeys:
Alt+Q: Teleport to quest.
Alt+E: Teleport to quest, offset in *current direction.*

Alt+F: Increase offset.
Alt+C: Decrease offset.

I uploaded it in an encrypted zip archive to prevent any possible issues downloading. If you share this with anyone, please send them this archive.

**Known Bugs:**
- Teleporting may teleport another player (only on your screen). This will be fixed eventually. I expect you to not use this around other players so this shouldn't be a major problem. I'll try to get the pointers correct as soon as possible to allow using with friends or when multiple instance support is added.
- The application can be ran more than once. Make sure you only run a single one. Each one will have an icon in the System Tray (by the clock in the taskbar). You can also close them from Task Manager or the `taskkill /im PeechezTrayner.exe /f` command. I'll make this a single instance application soon.
