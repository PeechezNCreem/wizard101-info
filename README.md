# wizard101-info
A collection of Wizard101 information I thought could be useful for someone.

Get Pirate101 information [here](https://github.com/PeechezNCreem/pirate101-info).

# Listing
`items/items.txt`: stats for every item and ids for each item card.

`monstrology/monsters.csv`: information for every monstrology creature including those impossible to get in game. The locations are not as accurate as I wish and slightly buggy for multiple locations.

`pets/talent-formulas.csv`: formulas to calculate the real values of pet talents. Use these for things like damage calculation.

`pets/talent-priority`: talent priorities for pet talents and derby abilities. Basically "Project O" but complete, by a single person in five minutes.

**Please notify me of any bugs or corrections that are not already documented!**
