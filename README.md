# wizard101-info
A collection of Wizard101 information I thought could be useful for someone.

# Listing
`items/items.txt`: stats for every item and ids for each item card.
`pets/talent-priority`: talent priorities for pet talents and derby abilities. Basically "Project O" but done by a single person in five minutes without making a single pet.
